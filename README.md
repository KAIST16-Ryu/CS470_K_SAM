# CS470_K_SAM

Hello everyone. We are team **Oldboys**, and it is our project results **K-SAM**.

It is Face Aging Model with AI_HUB's Korean face datasets.

All information about K-SAM is described below.

<br/>

Base paper for this Face Aging model is written and linked below. <br/>
 => [Only a Matter of Style: Age Transformation Using a Style-Based Regression Model](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.02754.pdf)
 
<br/>

The model configure and architecture is following the official github of the paper. <br/>
**Read below for our addition first, and follows official guide below.** <br/>

## Read carefully below to fully understand what we added.

### 1. Environment
- Use conda environment and install required models defined in **/environment/ksam_env.yml**.

### 2. Image Crop
##### Image Crop for Training

- You can explicitly crop your personal "Face Train Images" using **"/images/cropper.py"**
- You should **modify the code to fit your own datasets**.

##### Image Crop for Inference

- In **/datasets/inference_dataset.py**, you can annotate or not to choose whether activate cropping or not for the inference images.


### 3. Korean Image Dataset

- You can download the original dataset used in this project from here.
  [AI hub](https://aihub.or.kr/)
- Join there, find and download **가족관계가 알려진 얼굴 이미지 데이터**.
